# Code Playground 🎢

Welcome to my digital playground — where APIs get poked, libraries get bullied, and code lives a short but glorious life before it’s either deleted or promoted to a “real” project.  

## What happens here?
- I try random stuff.  
- Some of it works.  
- Most of it breaks.  
- That’s the fun part.  

## Why this repo exists
Because sometimes you need a place to make a mess before you cook the actual meal. Think of this as my kitchen counter full of experiments. 🍳

## Warning ⚠️
Don’t expect clean code. Don’t expect documentation. Sometimes don’t even expect logic.  

That’s the vibe. 😎
